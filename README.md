# Solving_killer_sudoku_in_SWI-Prolog
Example of solving killer sudoku in a program SWI-Prolog

Our final task in the end of a subject Knowlege representation was to create a programme in SWI-Prolog and we chose to solve one example of killer sudoku.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_sudoku
"Killer sudoku (also killer su doku, sumdoku, sum doku, sumoku, addoku, or samunamupure) is a puzzle that combines elements of sudoku and kakuro.

...

The objective is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 in a way that the following conditions are met:

Each row, column, and nonet contains each number exactly once.
The sum of all numbers in a cage must match the small number printed in its corner.
No number appears more than once in a cage. (This is the standard rule for killer sudokus, and implies that no cage can include more than 9 cells.)

In 'Killer X', an additional rule is that each of the long diagonals contains each number once."


Our programme is solving an example of killer sudoku from this page:

but with little changes can be solved any killer sudoku.

Here we are explaining how we create the code:
